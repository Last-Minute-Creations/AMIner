Comrade Director,

Sit down. What am I to do with you...? I just had a very honest conversation with your Chief Accountant. It is remarkable how cooperative a mother can become when the well-being of her children is at stake... and we did not even have to resort to beating!

But let's get to the point. Falsified invoices, forged waybillsâ€¦ Did you really think we wouldn't find out? That Central Accounting Dept. does not monitor such things?

Oh, Comrade Director, I fear you will not hold this position much longer with such an attitude toward Communism. Was it worth it? Was it worth ruining your career over a handful of forged documents?

You will receive an official Reprimand in your file. This could have been avoided. That is all, Comrade Director. I must now report this to the Ministry. Close the door on your way out.
