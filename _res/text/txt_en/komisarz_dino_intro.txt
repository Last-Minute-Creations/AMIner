Comrade Director, a moment of your time, if you please.
The State Academy of Sciences, in coordination with your Ministry and the Central Committee, has a matter that requires your attention. A task, important, yet... how shall we put it? Delicate in nature.
You see, Comrade, your satisfactory performance and efficient extraction efforts have not gone unnoticed. And now, you have the opportunity to contribute to the advancement of science - an endeavor that is, of course, viewed most favorably by the Ministry.
That being said, do not lose sight of your primary responsibilities.
Professor Ivan Jensonov will brief you on the details. He will be residing here for some time. Assist him as needed. I'm sure you understand the importance of cooperation.
