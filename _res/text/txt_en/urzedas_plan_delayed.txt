Comrade Director,
It is with deep regret that I must telegram the Ministry to report that the plan has not been completed within the designated time frame. I fully acknowledge that numerous factors may have contributed to this outcome, and I trust that the esteemed Planning Department will take these circumstances into due consideration.
However, Comrade, I must urge you to exercise greater vigilance in adhering to deadlines in the future. Failure to do so may result in a Reprimand entered into your official record. And tell me, Comrade - what purpose would such an unfortunate blemish serve? It reflects neither favorably upon you nor upon the collective efforts of this operation. Moreover, Central Headquarters takes such matters into serious account when assigning promotions.
Let us ensure that next time, there will be no cause for such concerns.
