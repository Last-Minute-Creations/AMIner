Comrade Director...

You are behind schedule. Seriously behind schedule. You do not seem to grasp the consequences of this for the entire country. The failure of your Mine to deliver the required resources disrupts the logistics and production chains of other facilities. This, in turn, delays the execution of plans for other Ministries.

To put it bluntly, Comrade, due to your incompetence, the military industry suffers and thus, so does the security of the nation. And that, Comrade, borders on sabotage and treason. I do not need to remind you what happens to traitors of the Motherland.

For now, you will receive a formal Reprimand in your file, but understand this: our patience and tolerance have its limits. Do not test them any further, or you will soon find yourself admiring the Northern Lights over Siberia, though not for long.
