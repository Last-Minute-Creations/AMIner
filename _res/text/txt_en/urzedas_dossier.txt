"(...) Comrades, we must remain ever conscious of the fact that, in the face of complex economic tasks and a challenging international situation fraught with threats and tensions, the vital interests of our nation demand from each and every one of us the highest degree of discipline and prudence. They demand an unshakable sense of responsibility for our homeland. And I will go even further - this must be our universal, patriotic duty. From our deliberations emerges a monumental charge of obligations.
We must, after thorough consideration, undertake decisive actions that will ensure that the results of the second half of this year surpass those of the first. (...)"
This man will make sure that our annual, quarterly, and monthly plans are executed with the utmost diligence.
Absolutely incorruptible... by insignificant sums.
