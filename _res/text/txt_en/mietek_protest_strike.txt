Mr. Boss!
It happened! Those ungrateful good-for-nothings, those lousy laborers, those reactionary collaborators - uh, I mean, the crew and those Trade Unions... they went on strike!
They're yappin' about how they won't work, put up some flags, and keep goin' on 'bout some kinda round table. Idiots, everyone knows tables are rectangle, and round ones are only in bars, and even then, they're tiny. They won't all fit at one, that's for sure!
And now they wanna make some kind of "Unity" Union, like all of 'em together against the People's Government, talkin' 'bout toppin' the... uh... system.
But Mietek ain't no fool. I got myself into their meetin' with a tape recorder under my jacket, and I got it all on tape! Here's the cassettes - the whole truth 'bout what went down.
But now they made some kinda committee, and we gotta talk to 'em, 'cause if Mr. Boss don't show things'll get better, they don't give a shit 'bout work no more - been six months since they got paid.
Mr. Boss, dear Sir, do somethin'! If not, well... guess ZOMO and a good ol' beatin' is all that's left.
