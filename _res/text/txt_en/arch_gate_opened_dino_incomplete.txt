Comrade Director!

We don't have much time. The evacuation of our team and collected samples is nearly complete, just a few more trucks and we're done. A pity we couldn't finish our project... but on the other hand, if we survive this, we have an unprecedented opportunity to observe these creatures in the flesh.

It is absolutely fascinating - living dinosaurs, here, in our country! Just imagine what this could mean, if only we can establish contact with their scientists. We, men of science, should rise above ideological differences.

I wish you luck, Comrade, and hope we shall meet again under more favorable circumstances.
