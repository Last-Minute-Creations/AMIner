Mr. Boss, I know ya just here for a bit, yeah. Gotta get that diggin' plan done so the Ministry hands ya them Accolades. Once ya stack up enough, they gonna promote ya an' ship ya off. But ya gotta watch outâ€”don't go gettin' no Reprimands!
An' that's why I'm here. I'm gonna help ya, Mr. Boss. Keep an eye on things, give ya advice an' all that.
But listen, when ya get outta here, don't forget `bout ol' Mietek, yeah? Take me with ya! `Cause this place? Nothin' but moonshine an' sweaty gals at dances in the fire station hall. I wanna see the world, Mr. Boss! Ya gonna remember, right?
