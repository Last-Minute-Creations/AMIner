Mr. Boss, I got a thing, but let's talk in private.
See, my brother-in-law's got a Kamaz truck, drivin' around different factories, and, well… it ain't just us who got “missing stock” in the warehouse, if ya catch my drift.
So, uh, he can get stuff from another mine—what we're lackin'. A lil' trade, ya know?
I left a note for ya in the Market on how we can swap things around. Just pick what ya need, confirm it, and my brother-in-law brings it in. Then we put it straight in the Warehouse.
Gotta help each other, right?
