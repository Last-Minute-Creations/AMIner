Director,
Welcome to 1985. Here, your possibilities are limitless, and life is simple and enjoyable. I'm sure you'll like it.
Once again, thank you for helping us gather the parts - without you, we would've been stuck there forever.
Well, it's time to say goodbye. I must return to the lab, we still have tests to conduct.
What should you do now? Honestly... I donâ€™t know. Maybe find something to manage? I'm sure you'll find an industry to thrive in. Just walk around and ask.
Ah, one more thing - if you're considering buying computers for business or home use, I highly recommend the Amiga 1000. Fantastic machine. Just launched last week... Oh, I already mentioned that? Well, it's really good. Multitasking!
Stay away from Atari - it has no future... I don't even know where it could be useful - maybe in farming?
I have to go now.
Good luck!
