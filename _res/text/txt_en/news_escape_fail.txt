Citizens,for the past several weeks, we have been closely following the trial of the Director of Mine No. 147, accused of collaborating with enemy intelligence, transferring technology, and attempting to escape to an aggressor nation. The Attorney General demanded the maximum penalty. This morning, the Supreme Tribunal delivered its verdict, finding the Director of Mine No. 147 guilty on all charges. The accused was placed before a firing squad, which carried out the lawful sentence on the spot. This is how traitors to the Nation end.
