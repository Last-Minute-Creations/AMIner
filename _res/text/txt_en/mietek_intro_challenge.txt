Uh... G-good mornin', Mr. Boss.
So ya showed up after all... We was startin' to think ya ain't comin', Mr. Boss.
A'ight, lemme get straight to the point. So, uh...
Ya dig down with the digger, and it's all 'bout time. Ya gonna see it on the lil' screen - always goin' down, down, down.
Along the way, there's spots where it counts what ya dug up so far.
An' at the very bottom, there's the finish line. Only the first one there gets credit for the last chunk o' diggin'.
Ya gotta watch out, though - if ya drive the digger off the edge o' that scrollin' screen, it poofs back to the middle, an' ya lose some o' what ya dug up.
An' uh... yeah, that's 'bout it.
Good luck, Mr. Boss, whole crew's rootin' for ya!
