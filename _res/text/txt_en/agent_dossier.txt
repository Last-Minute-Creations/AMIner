A secret agent in the service of Her Majesty. A frequent guest at Casino Royale. For his golden eye and golden finger, the world is not enough. Owner of a golden gun, encrusted with diamonds - which, as we all know, are forever.
Over a martini, he'll show you his license to kill and convince you that it's not time to die, even if you lived twice.
From his trip to Russia, he'll send you a postcard with greetings - just for your eyes only.
He is Agent 0.7.
Are you shaken or stirred?
