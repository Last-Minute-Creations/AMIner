Comrade Director!

Did you see what's coming through that portal? Of course you did - we stood side by side! What a breakthrough! This portal must lead to the Earth's interior, just as Verne described... or perhaps even better - to the past itself!

Do you realize the opportunities this presents for our science? Imagine dinosaurs repurposed for military applications - fascinating!

Now, of course, these are still Nazis... but I am convinced we can find common ground. After all, their scientists must be rational and intelligent individuals. We will reach an understanding.
