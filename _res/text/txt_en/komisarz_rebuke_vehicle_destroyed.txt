Comrade Director,
Come in. Sit down. Do you know what this is? This is the expert report on the complete destruction of a mining harvester due to improper use.

Tell me, Comrade Director, do you think this is your personal sandbox, where you can break your toys as you please? Or do you imagine that the Ministry's budget is limitless, ready to fund a new machine every time you destroy one?

This is expensive, state-of-the-art equipment, equipped with the latest technology not some wartime T-34 tanks that our factories can churn out by the millions! You were selected as the testing ground for the most advanced innovations and technologies! You should be pushing coal in wheelbarrows if you can't handle this!.

You are lucky we received additional prototypes, allowing us to continue operations. But do not think for a second that you will escape a Reprimand. Now, get back to work. And if I see as much as a scratch on the new harvester...
