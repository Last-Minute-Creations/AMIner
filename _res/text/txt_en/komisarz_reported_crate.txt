Comrade Director,

Sit down, have a drink. ... So, what's the news from underground? ... Crates, you say? Filled with apparatus and electronics? Interesting... Dig them up, dig them up... we'll send them to the Institute for analysis. Do you have any theories on how such things ended up at such a depth? No? We will return to this matter later... For now, I will send a report to the Ministry. Naturally, I will highlight your exemplary civic vigilance. Continue in this manner and a promotion is in your pocket. Good work, Comrade Director.
