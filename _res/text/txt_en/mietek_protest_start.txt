Mr. Boss, dear boss, we got a lil' situation `ere… Crew says no money, no work - simple as that. So they gone an' declared a protest.
Sayin' they gonna work exactly as much as ya pay `em, so ya see how it feels.
Now, don't worry, I been keepin' track—wrote down all the loudmouths right `ere in my notebook. See? Names, ready fer firin'.
But uh… thing is, they done locked themselves up in the hall, an' they ain't comin' out till money turns into real money. Their words, not mine.
An' if they still don't get paid, they say the Union's gonna call a strike… an' then, Mr. Boss, well… they say they gonna roll ya outta `ere on a wheelbarrow. That's what they said.
