Comrade Director,

I see that you are dutifully fulfilling your obligations to the People's Power and the Motherland. We have long suspected this "diplomat" to be a hostile agent, but you have served him to us on a silver platter. We will have a conversation with him, and you should know, on Lubyanka, we have specialists who can extract confessions even from the dead. I will personally send a telegram to the Ministry recommending Comrade Director for an Accolade. You will go far, Comrade. Very far...
