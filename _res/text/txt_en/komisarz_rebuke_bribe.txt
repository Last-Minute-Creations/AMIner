Comrade Director,

Sit down. Do you have any idea how important your sector is? How critical it is to fulfill assigned quotas and complete tasks ON TIME?

And yet, what do you do? You disrupt the established order of operationsâ€¦ by attempting to extend a deadline through bribery? BRIBING A STATE OFFICIAL?!

You have disappointed me, Comrade Director. Deeply.

I have no choice but to report this disgraceful act to the Ministry in full detail. You will receive an official reprimand in your file - of that, you can be certain.

That is all. You may leave.
