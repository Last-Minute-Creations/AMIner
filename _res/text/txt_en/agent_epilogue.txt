Mr. Director,
Welcome to England. No doubt you and your family are exhausted after such a long journey. Agent Pond mentioned that it was not without adventure. Fleeing from Kommissar Putienko's secret agents across half the world must have been quite a feat.
I apologize if things seemed uncertain at first. After all, fleeing to the Soviet Union wasn't what you expected, was it? But things improved from there - Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Egypt, and finally, sunny Italy. Though, I suspect that by then, you had enough of the sun. At last - England. The end of your wandering.
We couldn't take you out through your western border, they don't call it the Iron Curtain for nothing. Your government guards that route too well.
Are you aware that, in a way, you retraced the war path of one of your own generals from the Great War? But there will be time for stories later. Now, you and your family are safe with us. You will all receive new identities, documents, and a carefully crafted life history. You'll be placed in a quiet, secure location, under the protection of our government. After all, you have done us a great service.
Our scientists, after an initial analysis, believe that these technologies might be from the future. The theories leading to these inventions are only just being formulated in our time...
Once again, congratulations and thank you on behalf of Her Majesty and the entire MI6 department. From now on, Lieutenant Idle and Captain Cleese will take care of you. If you or your family need anything, don't hesitate to ask them.

Good luck, Mr. Director.
