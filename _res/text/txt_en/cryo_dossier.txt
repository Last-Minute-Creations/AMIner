A large crate, resembling an Egyptian sarcophagus, but with one difference - it has a small window, allowing you to peek inside.
Attached to it is a set of devices with blinking lights and a screen displaying messages.
Some exposed slots suggest that certain components are missing.
The entire structure emits unsettling sounds - hssss... pffff... - reminding one of a certain asthmatic figure from a distant galaxy.
Inside the sarcophagus, there is a man. A living man. His breathing is slow but steady. He appears to be in a deep sleep.
