Comrade Director, I'm glad I caught you before your departure. It is truly unfortunate that we were unable to complete this project under your leadership. I can only hope that your successor will display a greater interest in cooperation with the Institute and in the recognition that such collaboration could bring within our academic circles.

But of course, I understand. You hold an important position, with many responsibilities on your shoulders. The delivery of raw materials to the industry takes absolute priority.

I wish you success in your future endeavors. Perhaps our paths will cross again.
