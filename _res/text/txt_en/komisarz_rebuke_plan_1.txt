Comrade Director,

You have failed to follow instructions... You were given a simple task... and you botched it. The Ministry is not pleased. Do you even realize the position we are in?! We have made serious commitments... to the Ministry.. to the Party... and above all, to the People. The whole world is watching us, and YOU bring me this... this... garbage?! The Ministry will not tolerate your failures. This will go into your file. Do you know that we have at least a dozen... A DOZEN!!... applications from other highly qualified Comrades who would gladly take your place and serve the Country and the Party to the best of their ability?

Mark my words, Comrade... no one is irreplaceable, and our Recreational Facilities in Kamchatka are always open to incompetent fools like you. I must report this matter to the Ministry. Now get back to work.
