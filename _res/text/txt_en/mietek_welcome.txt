Ello, Mr. Boss, I'm Mietek – foreman `ere. Mr. Boss new, yeah? No worries, lemme show ya `round, show ya what's what.
Ev'rythin' `ere all modern, see? Elec… elecstro… uh, computery an' all that. If ya wanna do somethin', ya just press them buttons on the right, an' it pops up on that lil' telly.
Down `re ya got three channels: Warehouse, Workshop, an' Office. To turn `em on, ya yank that lever down till a lil' light starts blinkin', then ya push left or right to pick one an' press the button to confirm. Same thing with them arrow keys an' the Enter knob on the keyboard.
Even the big digger, ya steer it with that lever with a button or them keys on the keyboard.
If the digger's full, bust'd, or can't drill no more, ya drive it back to the factory, we fix ‘`r up an' unload `er. Spare parts cost ya, but no worries, we take the papers to the cash desk, Mr. Boss don't gotta think `bout it.
Oh, an' up top, there's a lil' screen – shows all kindsa important stuff or messages from the office. Keep yer eyes on it, real important!
