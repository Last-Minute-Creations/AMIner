Comrades!

To your positions! Officers, report to your units! You know your orders. All measurement apparatus on standby! Radio silence! If anyone speaks out of turn, I will have them before the firing squad faster than they can say Mother Russia.

They're coming! It's the Fritz! ... Battalions, FORWARD! For the Motherland!!! ... URAAaaa!!!
