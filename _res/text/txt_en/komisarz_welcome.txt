Ah, Comrade Director, there you are.
I am Kommissar Putienko, holding the rank of Kommissar. You may address me as Comrade Kommissar.
Sit down. Drink? I'll have one. Pour me a glass of Stalin's Tears. Yes, a full one.
Now then... I've looked over your file. Promising. A real zeal for work. That's commendable. I'll be calling you in from time to time, asking how things are progressing. And you, Comrade Director, will answer truthfully. Because if you intend to remain here for a while, you will speak the truth.
See, I have my ways. I always find out. And those who... let's say, omit certain details - well, we have fine vacation facilities out in Kamchatka for such individuals. But surely, there's no reason to discuss that. You are, after all, a loyal and upstanding Party member. Correct? Of course.
Now then. Get to work. And call in this Mietek fellow for me.
Oh, and one more thing - I like this office. You'll find yourself another one, won't you?
