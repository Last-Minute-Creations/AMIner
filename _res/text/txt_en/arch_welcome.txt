Good day, Comrade. Please, have a seat.

The matter I bring before you is a delicate one. One that concerns the reputation of the entire Academy. Allow me to explain briefly.

You see, Comrade, your mining operation is situated on geological strata rich in organic remains, in particular, dinosaur fossils. Our research has indicated the presence of a species previously unknown to science. Thus far, our findings have been fragmentary, but one of our subterranean expeditions has reached the immediate vicinity of your excavation sites. We are maintaining constant contact, and it is likely that our teams will soon cross paths.

Frankly speaking, Comrade, your equipment far surpasses anything our meager scientific grants can procure. That is why we come to you with a request: help us locate and extract the fossils that undoubtedly lie beneath your mine. Any uncovered finds must be handed over to the research team, who will catalog and document them. In return, I will personally ensure that your exemplary cooperation is recognized when I report back to the Capital. Rest assured, Comrade, your efforts will not go unnoticed.
