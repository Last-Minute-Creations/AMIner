Zdravstvuyte, Comrade Director.
The Ministry of Mining and Fossil Fuels calls upon you to extract a specified quantity of minerals as part of the National Extraction Plan. This year, we undertake this mission in honor of the 65th anniversary of the commencement of the Communist Revolution in our People's Democratic Republic. To demonstrate our unwavering dedication and immense sacrifice to the Leaders of our Party - those who, over six decades ago, ignited the flames of Revolution and shattered the yoke of bourgeois oppression upon the People - we shall exceed the Annual National Extraction Plan by 600%.
This task is not a simple one, and the Ministry is fully aware of the challenges ahead. Yet, with such shining examples as our Party Leaders and with workers guided by Comrades as devoted as yourself, we shall accomplish the plan on time and in full. Naturally, we recognize that great achievements cannot be realized all at once. Thus, we have divided the overall goal among all mines and industrial enterprises so that each may contribute to our common cause. Furthermore, the overarching plan for each mining operation has been segmented into smaller stages to ensure timely completion.
Very soon, you will begin receiving telegrams from the Ministry detailing the precise mineral quotas required. Read them carefully and fulfill them meticulously, down to the very last unit. Remember, Comrade Director - efficiency and precise planning are the keys to victory.
The eyes of the entire Nation are upon you, Comrade... Do not disappoint them. Do not disappoint the Party.
