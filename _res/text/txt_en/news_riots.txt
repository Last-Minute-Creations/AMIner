Citizens of the People's Democratic Republic, I address you on a matter of the utmost importance. The legacy of generations is crumbling. Our faltering economy takes new blows every day. Strikes and protests have become the norm. Calls for a reckoning with the Communists grow louder. Chaos and demoralization have reached catastrophic proportions, and our Nation has reached the limits of psychological endurance. Not days, but hours separate us from a nationwide disaster. Did it have to come to this? Did we do everything possible to stop the downward spiral? History will judge our actions. We have stumbled, but we learn from our mistakes. Our economy has become a battlefield of political conflict. Deliberate and calculated sabotage of the Government and administration's efforts has resulted in disproportionate outcomes compared to the effort, labor, and intentions invested. One cannot deny us goodwill, restraint, and patience. However, the time has come to say ENOUGH! We must prevent the confrontation announced by the leaders of “Unity.” We say this on the day when the date of mass public demonstrations is known. We cannot and must not allow these events to become the spark that ignites the entire country. We must bind the hands of agitators before they plunge our homeland into the abyss of fratricidal war. Citizens! I hereby announce that today, the Military Council for National Salvation has been established. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Council of State has declared martial law as of midnight today, across the entire country.
