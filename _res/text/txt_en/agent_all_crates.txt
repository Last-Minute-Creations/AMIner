Mr. Director,
You have already provided me with enough crates. My mission is coming to an end. However, my government has authorized me to offer you asylum in England.
Arranging your transfer will take some time, and the operation carries certain risks but it can be done.
If you are interested, please inform me, and we will be ready.
