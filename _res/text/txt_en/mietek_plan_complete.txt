Mr. Boss, so, uh... me an' the boys, we got this lil' thing goin' on, yeah? After shift, sometimes on Saturdays, we run these, uh... digger races.
Ya know, two machines, diggin' down, first one to the finish wins, an' then we count up how much dirt they hauled out.
If Mr. Boss wanna join, just switch that lil' telly to Game Mode an' set it to Races - boom, ready to go!
An' don't worry, I'll explain all the rules proper right before we start.
