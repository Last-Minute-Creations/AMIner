Comrade Director,

You have finally done it. We pleaded, we warned, we appealed to your sense of duty. But you have shown nothing but contempt for the trust the Party placed in you. And I had taken you for a proper Comrade... a true Communist. I vouched for you personally before the Minister of National Security. What a disgrace.

I even grew somewhat fond of you over time... so many reports, and a few drinks shared... a song or two. Almost felt like comrades-in-arms... like in the trenches. But I was mistaken, Comrade. Deeply mistaken.

You know what awaits you, so let's not make this any harder than it needs to be. Sign your resignation, it's on the desk. Sign the farewell letter to your family as well, you will not be seeing them again.

Now, leave. The black Volga is already waiting for you at the back entrance.

And go quickly, before I change my mind and have you shot right here.
