Fantastic! You found one of our crates!
Yes, yes... everything is here. But it's not enough... definitely not enough. We need to generate more power... exactly 1.21 gigawatts. I could use a lightning strike, but at this depth, a thunderstorm is unlikely.
Please find the rest of the crates. Inside, we have spare parts that will allow us to reconstruct the missing components of the fusion generator and return to our time.
Five crates, Director. Five crates in total will be enough. Of course, once we're ready, you can travel with us. There's plenty of room, and you might enjoy where we're from.
1985 of course.
You have to see it! We live in an era of bold and revolutionary inventions! Just last week, I attended the premiere of a 16-bit computer that will change the world. I'm sure of it.
Excuse me, I must work on the capacitor.
The crates... please bring me the crates...
And remember, the flux capacitor is activated at exactly 1.21 gigawatts of power.
