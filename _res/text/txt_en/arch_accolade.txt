Comrade Director, come in, come in...

Please, take a seat. Would you care for a drink? Ah! The occasion calls for it!

I was just telling Comrade Putienko that, thanks to your invaluable assistance, we have successfully reconstructed a perfectly preserved skeleton of a previously unknown dinosaur species. This is your achievement, Comrade Director.

Of course, the scientific value of these remains had to be verified and studied by our archaeologists but none of this would have been possible without your cooperation. We have just finalized the documentation for Communosaurus Amineryx, as we have named it, and I am sending it to the Institute as we speak.

An outstanding accomplishment! Congratulations, Comrade, both from myself and from the entire scientific community.

Comrade Putienko would like to add a few words.
