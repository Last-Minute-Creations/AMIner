Good day,
I am Jay Miner, the creator of Amiga - the best computer in the world.
I want to sincerely thank you for being a loyal fan of Amiga all these years, ensuring that our Friend remains in use.
I also have a small gift for you.
Here is a floppy disk containing my favorite game. I believe you'll enjoy it - the author dedicated an immense amount of time and energy to it.
Press Warehouse to play.
