Citizens of the People's Democratic Republic! Our homeland has stood at the precipice of catastrophe. Until recently, we faced an unimaginable and insidious threat. The enemy, whom we believed vanquished during the Great Patriotic War, did not perish completely. Like a cockroach scurrying into the darkness, it merely burrowed underground, biding its time, hatching vile plots to seize power over the world once more. Unnoticed, it grew in strength, poised to strike at the most unexpected moment. It clandestinely developed new weapons and technologies designed to bring our society, our industry, and our mighty army to its knees. But such delusions of grandeur were for naught! Through the unwavering vigilance and exemplary civic duty of Comrades such as Director of Mine No. 147 and his brave miners, the Security Service obtained critical intelligence regarding the imminent invasion. Our Army took swift and decisive countermeasures, and when the hordes of subterranean Nazis emerged, believing themselves triumphant, they were instead encircled and annihilated - crushed under the steel boots of our invincible Armed Forces, just as one crushes an insect. Thanks to the heroic dedication of a single mine director, our citizens may now look to the future with confidence and optimism. Thanks to his actions, our Army has secured valuable enemy weaponry, our scientists now have access to cutting-edge technology, and we have even uncovered prehistoric reptilian species long thought extinct. Together, these momentous achievements affirm that we no longer ask IF our great Nation will lead all of humanity-only WHEN. And the answer, Comrades, is simple: VERY SOON! In recognition of his unparalleled service, the Central Committee hereby proclaims the Director of Mine No. 147 a National Hero and summons him to the capital, where the highest honors and a ministerial position await. Congratulations, Comrade!
