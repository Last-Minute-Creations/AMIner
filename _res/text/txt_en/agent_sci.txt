Mr. Director,
I can address you this way, correct? After all, we are both gentlemen.
I have one request. Please hand over the recovered crates to me, rather than to the Yanks.
You see, I offer you a decent sum for each delivery. And if our cooperation remains fruitful, my superiors may arrange for you to be comfortably settled shall we say, on the other side of the Curtain.
Of course, with your family and a generous bank account, ensuring a life of luxury and an early retirement.
The Yanks, on the other hand... well, they always show up when there's something to gain. But they discard their allies just as quickly as a woman of easy virtue discards her lingerie. Striking deals with them is only profitable for them in the long run.
Don't look so surprised. Just because we play on the same "imperialist" team, as you might put it, doesn't mean we must share everything.

So, do we have a deal?
