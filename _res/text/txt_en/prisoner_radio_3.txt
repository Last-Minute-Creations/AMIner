Mr. Director...
It has all come back to me. It was during the war. I was imprisoned here along with many others. We were used for experiments.
The Nazis had discovered some ancient bas-reliefs depicting blasphemous gods, inscriptions in a language not of this world. Other prisoners whispered stories about it.
Krauts found this place, and their scientists managed to activate the Portal. They sent us through for testing, for study. Those who returned spoke of horrors of a world where the sun never moved from its zenith, where there was no horizon, as if one stood inside a sphere.
They spoke of colossal lizards, of beasts with membranous wings. They spoke of abandoned cities, of structures that defied geometry and reason, filled with statues of monstrous beings from beyond time and space.
Soon after, those who had seen it died in madness, foaming at the mouth. And then... the nightmares began. I remember only an eye staring at me from the abyss.
Then came the order. They forced us to load cargo and send it through the Portal. So many people. Equipment. Weapons. Tanks. Everything covered in strange cables, supposedly for protection. They said we, too, would be sent to work on the other side.

When my turn came, something happened. The earth shook. The Portal cracked. I felt a rifle butt strike my head. I fell into the Portal. Blinding pain-searing light. And then... darkness.
That's where you found me. I remember nothing else.
Whatever you are doing here, Mr. Director, be careful. Do not listen to the voices in the transmission.
Some things... are better left undisturbed.
