Comrade Director,
You have been entrusted with the vital task of delivering ores of designated metals and minerals - resources essential to the unyielding march of our People's Democratic Republic toward industrial greatness. The current required quantities have been meticulously outlined in the inventory manifest at the warehouse.
The time allotted for the fulfillment of this plan is strictly limited. Remember, efficiency above all! The gears of progress turn for no one - adherence to deadlines is not merely expected, but demanded. Let no delay tarnish the unwavering discipline and dedication that define the true vanguard of our Socialist labor force.
