Comrade Director,

Guess what we found during the last inspection of the Warehouse? In the broom closet... Yes, and beneath that tarp, crates filled with... highly advanced apparatus and electronics, likely of Western origin. Do you know anything about this? DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL?! I have testimonies from four witnesses who saw you hiding them there with that imbecile Mietek. I should send you to Kamchatka for this, but you might still be of use.

From now on, every batch of excavated material will be subject to rigorous inspection, and anything that is not a raw resource will be reported directly to me! Personally! I am now sending a report to the Ministry. This will end with Reprimand but if it were up to me, I would gladly put you in front of a... Ugh! Get out of my sight!
