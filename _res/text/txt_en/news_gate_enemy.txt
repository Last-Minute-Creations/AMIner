Citizens! We hereby inform you that as of today, the Thousand-Year Reich, under the leadership of our Fuhrer Otto von Hitzler, will exercise absolute power over the world. At this very moment, as this proclamation is being delivered, our Sturmtruppen are eliminating the last pockets of Allied resistance, thus completing the work begun by the previous FÃ¼hrer - Adolf Hitler. Soon after the unconditional surrender of all world governments, the process of racial purity verification will commence. Individuals displaying genetic traits of the Aryan race will receive appropriate documentation and classification categories. The rest - including Jews, Arabs, Asians, Africans, other colored races, homosexuals, other deviants, and lunatics - after examination by the appropriate medical commissions, will be assigned to labor camps or deported into the Earth's interior via the Portal. We remind you that return is impossible, and personal belongings are prohibited on the other side. All possessions and valuables must be left behind at the requisition centers. If an individual prefers to end their life instead of the aforementioned options, please report to the on-duty SS officer, who will direct you to the nearest execution site. We also offer self-cremation kits and provide mobile crematoriums, the relevant authorities have schedules for when a crematorium will be available in your area. Remember: Attempting to hide a person classified as "labor camp" or "deportation" will result in the immediate execution of all residents of the building, regardless of their classification. Report your neighbor before they report you! Cooperating with the Gestapo may ensure an execution without torture. Report immediately! That is all for today. Heil Hitzler!
