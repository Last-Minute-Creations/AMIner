Thank you, Comrade Jensonov.
Well now, Comrade Director, you have done well. I am submitting a recommendation for a state decoration on your behalf. An Accolade for contributions to scientific progress will also be added to your file - something the Central Office will certainly take into account when considering your future advancement.
Good work. Maintain this course, this level of dedication to the Party's objectives, and before you know it, promotion will be within your grasp.
However, do not forget - we are watching you closely. You may stand in the spotlight now, but a single misstep... and no one will ever hear your name again. EVER.
You may return to your work.
