Comrade Director,

Sit down. There are reports coming in. Troubling reports. I know that you've discovered Nazi bunkers and installations underground. What I fail to understand is why you did not inform me. Did you think I WOULDN'T FIND OUT?! Comrade Director... it seems your priorities have become... confused. Perhaps you have forgotten what happens to traitors of the People's Power and the Motherland? Let me remind you. They stand before a firing squad! If it were up to me, you'd already be there. However, the Party has other plans for you.

You will uncover the remaining elements of this so-called Portal, you will assemble it, you will report to me, and we shall see what happens next. The Ministry will send specialists from Department X, they know how to handle such things. If you lie to me again, I guarantee you will face that firing squad. Bureaucratic errors happen, and by the time they get sorted out... well... the man is gone already.
