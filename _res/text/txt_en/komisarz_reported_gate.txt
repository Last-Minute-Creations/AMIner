Comrade Director,

Sit down, please. Tell me, what interesting things have you found? (...) Mhm... Fascinating. An underground Nazi base, you say? It's good that you came to me with this. Here's what we'll do. You will locate all the components of this so-called Portal and once you do, you will inform me. In the meantime, I will send a telegram to the Ministry, to Department X, we have specialists for such matters there. Naturally, I will mention your contributions in my report, and perhaps the Department will see fit to reward your efforts.
