Boss,
We are experiencing a cash flow deficit. I have outstanding invoices stacking up to here! In a moment, I'll have to process payroll, and I need to know where exactly I'm supposed to find the funds for that...
If the Tax Office decides to conduct an audit, they'll have us hauled away on a wheelbarrow for financial mismanagement.
I am in no position to make recommendations, but I have been informed that Mietek's brother-in-law is known to purchase unreported output in unlimited quantities and pays in cash.
If the workforce doesn't receive their wages on time, they might initiate some kind of protest action - or worse - a strike! I overheard some concerning discussions in the cafeteria.
Please resolve this matter urgently, or we may be facing serious consequences.
