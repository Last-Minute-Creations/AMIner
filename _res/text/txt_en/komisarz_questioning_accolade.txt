Comrade Director,

Please, please... Pour yourself and me a glass of Stalin's Tears and have a seat, sit down. Now! I wanted to personally inform you that just moments ago, the First Secretary himself called me regarding your case. He instructed me to tell you that he is proud to have such devoted members in our Party. Your cooperation with the Security Services has been exemplary. These are the First Secretary's very words - word for word.

As a token of recognition, you are awarded an Accoladen from the Ministry and the Order of Merit for Socialism. To your health!

Ah! But that is not all, come here, to the window. Come, come... I took the liberty of gathering the entire workforce in the assembly square so that they too may express their enthusiasm.

For the Director, three cheers...

Hip! Hip! HURRAA!!
Hip! Hip! HURRAA!!
Hip! Hip! HURRAA!! HURRAA!! HURRAA!!
