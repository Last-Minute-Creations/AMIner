Comrade!
By the resolute decree of the Ministry of Mining and Fossil Fuels, you have been assigned to this distinguished facility. At first glance, this mine may appear modest, yet we have every reason to believe that its full potential remains untapped. As you are undoubtedly aware, the advancement of our Glorious People's Democratic Republic necessitates substantial investments in the sector of heavy industry - an industry whose remarkable achievements shall not only astound and bewilder the western imperialists but shall stand as a testament to our nation's indomitable will before the entire world. An industry of unparalleled significance, fortifying our Great Army as it valiantly defends the Motherland and liberates fraternal nations from the suffocating grip of imperialist and capitalist oppression.
Comrade, your mission here is straightforward yet of the utmost importance. Your task is simply to fulfill the extraction plans, which shall be relayed to you by telegram from the Ministry. To aid you in this endeavor, we entrust you with a brigade of exceptionally skilled and dedicated workers - men of unwavering resolve, who embody the spirit of the working class and the ideals of Communism. These are not mere laborers; they are the true sons of this land, forged in the fire of revolutionary struggle, unshaken in their commitment to the common cause.
Furthermore, you shall be equipped with the latest marvels of our nation's engineering ingenuity - machines of formidable power, state-of-the-art equipment, and an ample supply of spare parts to ensure uninterrupted productivity.
Our Great Leader places his unwavering trust in his Comrades, yet, as a humble son of the soil himself, he understands the value of firsthand knowledge. Thus, in its boundless wisdom, the Ministry has deemed it prudent to assign to this facility an observer from the Department of National Security. This devoted servant of the people is to be regarded as your most trusted confidant. You may rely upon him as you would upon your own kin. Moreover, any significant or unusual discoveries unearthed in the course of your labor should be reported to him without hesitation.
We bid you success in this great endeavor, Comrade!
