Comrade!

You have been sent to this facility by the decision of Ministry of Mining and Fossile Fuels. The outpost is small but we believe not yet fully explored and examined. As you know, development of our great Democratic Peoples Republic requires significant expenditures in the sector of heavy industry. Industry that will astound and amaze with its creations not only imperialist in the West but the whole world. Industry that is so important for our great Army that protects our Motherland and helps to liberate more and more nations from the imperial and capitalist occupant.

Comrade, your task here is very simple, yet so much important. All you need to do is to fulfill the mining plans that will be sent to you in the form of a telegram from the Ministry of Mining and Fossile Fuels. We are putting some hard working employees under your command to help you achieve those goals. They are true communists and the sons of this land.

We are also giving you our latest and newest technology and machinery together with some great amount of spare parts in case you need them.

Our Great Leader trusts his Comrades but likes to keep an eye on different aspects of life of his fellow countrymen. After all he is also just a simple farmer from the province. Therefore an observant from Ministry of National Security will be sent out to your facility. You can trust him like own brother and we expect you will inform him of any special findings and discoveries, should you encounter any in your underground work.

Good luck Comrade!
