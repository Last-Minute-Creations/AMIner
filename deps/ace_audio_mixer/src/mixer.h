 * This is the C header file for the Audio Mixer. The Audio Mixer is written

 * As supplied, the header file should work for VBCC and Bebbo's GCC compiler.
 *
 * To use the Audio Mixer in C programs, the mixer.asm file still must be
 * assembled into an object file, with mixer_config.i set up correctly for the
 * desired use.
 *
 * Note: in mixer_config.i, the value MIXER_C_DEFS must be set to 1 for this
 *       header file to work.

	Callback vectors have to be passed through the MXIRQDMACallbacks
	structure. This structure contains the following members:
	* mxicb_set_irq_vector
	  - Function pointer to routine that sets the IRQ vector for audio
		interrupts.
		Parameter: A0 = vector to mixer interrupt handler

		Note: the mixer interrupt handler will return using RTS rather
		      than RTE when using external IRQ/DMA callbacks. This behaviour
		      can be overridden by setting MIXER_EXTERNAL_RTE to 1, in which
		      case the interrupt handler will exit using RTE.
	* mxicb_remove_irq_vector
	  - Function pointer to routine that removes the IRQ vector for
		audio interrupts.

		Note: if MIXER_EXTERNAL_BITWISE is set to 1, this routine is also
	          responsible for resetting INTENA to the value it had prior to
			  calling MixerInstallHandler() if this is desired.

			  when MIXER_EXTERNAL_BITWISE is set to 0, this is done by the
			  mixer automatically
	* mxicb_set_irq_bits
	  - Function pointer to routine that sets the correct bits in INTENA
		to enable audio interrupts for the mixer.
		Parameter: D0 = INTENA bits to set

		Note: if MIXER_EXTERNAL_BITWISE is set to 1, the relevant bits are
		      passed as individual INTENA values, where the set/clear bit is
			  set as appropriate
	* mxicb_disable_irq
	  - Function pointer to routine that disables audio interrupts
        Parameter: D0 = INTENA bits to disable

		Note: if MIXER_EXTERNAL_BITWISE is set to 1, the relevant bits are
		      passed as individual INTENA values, where the set/clear bit is
			  set as appropriate
        Note: this is a separate routine from mxicb_set_irq_bits because
              disabling interrupts should also make sure to reset the
              corresponding bits in INTREQ
	* mxicb_acknowledge_irq
	  - Function pointer to routine that acknowledges audio interrupt.
		Parameter: D0 = INTREQ value

		Note: this will always pass the INTREQ value for a single channel.
	* mxicb_set_dmacon
	  - Function pointer to routine that enables audio DMA.
		Parameter: D0 = DMACON value

		Note: if MIXER_EXTERNAL_BITWISE is set to 1, the relevant bits are
		      passed as individual DMACON values, where the set/clear bit is
			  set as appropriate


    Note: MixerSetup should be run before this routine
    Note: if MIXER_C_DEFS is set to 0, all callback routines should save &
          restore all registers they use.

          If MIXER_C_DEFS is set to 1, registers d0,d1,a0 and a1 will be
          pushed to and popped from the stack by the mixer. All callback
